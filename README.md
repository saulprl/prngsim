# PRNG Sim

PRNG Sim is a React Native mobile app for generating pseudo-random numbers using implementations of algorithms such as the Middle Squares mehod, the Linear Congruential Generator, the Multiplicative Congruential Generator, and the Constant Multiplier method.

## Getting started

This project was bootstrapped with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/). To run the app, you can check out Expo's docs for instructions.

## How it works

Although there's only one screen, the app uses [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/). This only screen allows you to choose between the four algorithms mentioned above. After choosing one, you can input the values needed for the algorithm to work and then generate the pseudo-random numbers.
